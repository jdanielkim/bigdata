# Big Data Final: 2005-2006 Taiwanese Credit Card Crisis 

By: JD Kim

The notebook is marked with directions and easy to follow. The data will be emailed since Github does not allow large CSV files. However, all of the outputs of the notebook should be visible.

There are two primary questions that this notebook is trying to address through data analysis. How do monthly billings as well as monthly payments relate to the macroeconomic variable FX rates and do socio-demographic variables affect the probability of default? This is supported through the jupyter notebook, however, for explinations please take a look at my paper. 

If there are any questions, please email jkim3@bates.edu.
